This repository contains data and code supporting the following paper:

<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/05/18/1800795115">Bang & Fleming (2018) “Distinct encoding of decision confidence in human medial prefrontal cortex” </a>

FigureX.m files will generate the specified plots from the paper by loading behavioural data, model predictions and/or fMRI ROI data.

The paths in these scripts require altering the directory variable ‘repoBase’ to point to your local version of the repository.

Unthresholded group-level statistical maps supporting whole-brain analyses are available on NeuroVault: https://neurovault.org/collections/3792/.

**Folders**

*Custom*

Contains custom scripts for data extraction and plotting.

*Data*

Contains anonymised behavioural data for the pre-scan (Data/Behaviour/Prescen) and the scan (Data/Behaviour/Prescen) sessions, ROI contrast estimates (Data/Scan/Contrast), ROI single-trial activity estimates (Data/Scan/Activity) and ROI activity time courses (Data/Scan/Timecourse).

*HDDM*

Contains scripts for hierarchical DDM fitting using the HDDM toolbox (http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/) and generation of posterior predictives using the DMAT toolbox (https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/software/dmat/). 

*Model*

Contains scripts for fitting confidence model to pre-scan data and generating out-of-sample predictions about subjective confidence for scan data.

*Permutation*

Contains scripts for permutation testing for analysis of ROI activity time courses.

*SPM*

Contains scripts for setting up GLMs of fMRI data. fMRI data were pre-processed using standard pipelines available here: https://github.com/metacoglab/MetaLabCore. All fMRI analyses were done using SPM 12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). 

*Upsample*

Contains example script for creating ROI activity time courses.

*Preprint*
